When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When project is being developed by more than one preson.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I may not want to have changes made by other. I may want to work on my current local repositary. If there is auto pull my code will change according to what is present at github repo currently.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork: It  is type of clone from github server to github server.
Clones: From github to local computer or local to local.
Branches: different path is a same repo.
